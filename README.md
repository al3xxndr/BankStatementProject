# BankStatementProject
This project simulates a banking system in its most fundamental form. The interesting thing is that you can run it 
in different languages using void functions.

Okay so I am gonna make this as simple to understand and as short as possible. There are several void statments and they are ran in main.
The important thing is that you remember which each does.
I put comments in it and its pretty self explanitory.
There is a spanish void funtion where everything is translated in spanish.
and there is an english one  which runs exactly the same.

It's a blast to play around with so have fun!
